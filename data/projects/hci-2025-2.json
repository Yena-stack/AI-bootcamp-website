    "description": "Mood to Music addresses the need for technology that can understand emotions from natural language and deliver customized playlists immediately, while prioritizing maximum results with minimal user effort through simple controls. Finding a song that fits a specific activity or subtle emotion often involves a cumbersome manual process , especially when users start from a feeling rather than a concrete track or artist.",

    "description": "This project implements a finAI prototype that transforms novice investors’ confusion into a structured “learn–act–reflect” loop, integrating the principles of personalization, trust, and habit formation. The platform supports onboarding- and micro-survey–based personalization, news summarization with an AI mentor, loss-free simulated trading, and behavior correction through transaction logging and weekly reports. In addition, user surveys revealed high expectations for fundamental investment features, leading us to identify enhanced portfolio visualization and notification mechanisms as key directions for future improvements. Future work will focus on strengthening trust and usability across diverse user groups. This includes refining lightweight, safety-oriented models for risk-sensitive interactions, expanding long-term persona adaptation, and exploring greater LLM specialization through role-specific agents while evaluating how different levels of AI transparency affect user comfort in financial decision-making.",
